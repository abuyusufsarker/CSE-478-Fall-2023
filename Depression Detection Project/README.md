## Introduction

Depression is a prevalent mental health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for better outcomes. This project harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to create a system that can analyze textual data, such as social media posts or survey responses, to identify signs of depression.


## Features

## Usage

Utilizing the Depression Detection System involves the following steps, harnessing the power of natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from users or relevant sources, such as social media posts or surveys. This data will serve as the input for the analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Prior to analysis, preprocess the collected data to ensure it is clean and properly formatted. This step is crucial for accurate results.

3. **System Execution**: Execute the system, taking advantage of advanced natural language processing techniques and CNN. Provide the preprocessed data as input to the system.

4. **Interpret the Results**: Upon execution, the system will generate results indicating the likelihood of depression based on the analysis. Interpret these results to identify potential signs of depression.

Please keep in mind that this system is designed for research and educational purposes and should not replace professional medical advice. The integration of NLP techniques and CNN enhances the accuracy and effectiveness of the analysis.


## Dataset
You can access the dataset used in this project by following this [Suicide and Depression Detection
 ]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhileswarkomati/suicide-watch?fbclid=IwAR1dNFNpod_tQCAV6iaBmoBDMSEq-5_LERu1xsTaydG8gNnS-KcdvB2Li54).  
 **About Dataset**

The dataset is a collection of posts from the "SuicideWatch" and "depression" subreddits of the Reddit platform. The posts are collected using Pushshift API. All posts that were made to "SuicideWatch" from Dec 16, 2008(creation) till Jan 2, 2021, were collected while "depression" posts were collected from Jan 1, 2009, to Jan 2, 2021. All posts collected from SuicideWatch are labeled as suicide, While posts collected from the depression subreddit are labeled as depression. Non-suicide posts are collected from r/teenagers.

## Installation
## Dependencies

The success of this project hinges on the utilization of various Python libraries, with a particular focus on those supporting natural language processing (NLP) techniques and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The key libraries include:

- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- TensorFlow and Keras (for advanced NLP and CNN implementation)

To ensure the smooth operation of the project and take full advantage of its natural language processing capabilities, it is crucial to have these libraries properly installed. They empower the system with the tools needed for effective text analysis and depression detection.
